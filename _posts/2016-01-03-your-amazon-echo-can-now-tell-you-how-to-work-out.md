description: "Amazon's Echo personal assistant (powered by Alexa) is an unusual device that's had a very beta-existence since its launch last summer. It still struggles to hear certain commands, and its utility is limited to certain areas, but that isn't stopping Amazon from releasing new features - like a new fitness option announced this week."
