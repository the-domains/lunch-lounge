description: "In 2001, census-takers in the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries noticed a curious trend: nearly 1% of responders designated their religion as Jedism. The impact of a film released nearly 40 years ago is obvious. It's only a slight exaggeration to say those who love \"Star Wars\" do so religiously."
